# GDP of India Forecasting using Machine Learning and Deep Learning
* Gross domestic product (GDP) is the single standard indicator used across the globe to indicate
the health of a nation's economy: one single number that represents the monetary value of all
the finished goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific period. GDP
may be easy to define but it is complex to calculate, and different countries employ different
methods.
* In India, the rate of GDP is fixed on the basis of average enhancement or decline in the
production in agriculture, manufacturing and service sector. If we say that there is a 2%
increase in GDP of India, then it implies that the economy of India is growing at the rate of 2%.
But often, in these statistics the inflation rate is not included. In India, the GDP is calculated in
every three months and the figures of GDP depend on production rate of major economic
sectors.
* We pursue a new approach to forecasting by employing a number of machine learning
algorithms, a method that is data driven, and imposing limited restrictions on the nature of the
true relationship between input and output variables. We apply the available Machine learning 
algorithms on raw data of advanced and emerging economies of India and find the best of
these algorithms which can outperform traditional statistical models, thereby offering a
relevant addition to the field of economic forecasting
